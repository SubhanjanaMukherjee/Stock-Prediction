# Stock-Prediction
This Jupyter Notebook code demonstrates how to use LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) to predict the stock price of WIPRO, a multinational IT company. The code loads the stock data, preprocesses it, and trains an LSTM model to forecast future stock prices. It includes data scaling, sequence preparation, model building, and evaluation. The predicted prices are then compared with the actual prices and visualized using matplotlib. The code serves as a practical example of time series forecasting and can be used to gain insights into LSTM-based stock price prediction.
